# CS-230-Gaming-Room-
Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client’s software design problem is regarding a web-based game, “Draw It or Lose It”, where teams compete in four rounds attempting to guess the puzzle. They have asked specifically to incorporate the ability to have multiple teams each with assigned players and unique ID’s. There can only be one instance of the game in memory. We will accomplish these requests by ensuring we utilize unique identifiers for every instance of player, game, & team. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I believe that I summarized the clients problem very well and also made a strong confident recommendation to their operating systems.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Having something to check my code against helped, the user stories helped me create the correct code.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I believe I could have done a better job at describing the UML model and provide a better comparison of operating platforms and the cost associated with each.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The user needs are what the customer wants the software or system to accomplish, I started by implementing exactly what was asked for and not going above and beyond which could have led to exhausted time and resources.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I took an agile approach and listed to the clients requirements and made sure to address their problems in my design process. When analyzing and designing a similar software application, key techniques and strategies include: user research to deeply understand needs, competitor analysis, prototyping to test concepts, iterative development with Agile methodologies, data analytics to track usage patterns, design thinking to foster creativity, and thorough quality assurance testing to ensure functionality and usability
